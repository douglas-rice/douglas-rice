    <h3>Who <em>are</em> you?</h3>
    <p>I am an aspiring web developer living in Eugene Oregon. I love to code, read novels, ride classic motorcycles, and eat cereal. I have been a student of html, css, JavaScript, and Ruby for several years and hope to transition my career into front-end development.</p>
    <h3>Describe yourself with two adjectives that begin with the letter 'A':</h3>
    <p>anxious, affable.</p>
    <h3>What's important to you?</h3>
    <p>Family, friends, learning things, thinking about stuff, old art forms, dogs and cats.</p>
    <h3>What do you understand about the world?</h3>
    <p>Not as much as i'd like.</p>
    <h3>If you could have a super power, what would it be?</h3>
    <p>I would like to have the power of instant and timely anecdotes at dinner parties.</p>
    <h3>What are you reading lately?</h3>
    <p>Just finished Dave Egger's new book, "Heroes of the Frontier".  It's a picaresque road story told from the POV of a single Mom having a crisis. He's versitile, right?</p>
