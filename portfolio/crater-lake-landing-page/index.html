        From high atop a cliff's rim you can barely see it through the mist. A lake so incomprensibly blue it redefines the color. 7,700 years ago, Native Americans witnessed its very beginnings when a violent eruption triggered the collapse of a towering volcano. Scientists marvel at its purity: fed by rain and snow, itâ€™s the deepest lake in the USA and perhaps the most pristine on earth.

        <h2>Abundant Wildlife</h2>
        <p>
         The animal species living in Crater Lake are typical of the diversity of animals found in the southern High Cascades. There are significant populations of Roosevelt elk, black bear, pronghorn, coyote, and porcupine. The western and southern portions of the park contain the largest animal populations because of the presence of permanent streams.

During the winter months, from October through June, weather conditions make preparing for extreme winter conditions necessary. Due to the elevation of the park, weather conditions may change quickly so pack accordingly. Here are a few tips:
